    title: `Chilling video footage becomes key exhibit in Trump trial`,

      'Chilling video footage becomes key exhibit in Trump trial.By LISA MASCARO, ERIC TUCKER, MARY CLARE JALONICK and JILL COLVINFebruary 11, 2021 GMT.WASHINGTON (AP) — Chilling security video of last month’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol , including of rioters searching menacingly for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence, has become a key exhibit in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial as lawmakers prosecuting the case wrap up their opening arguments for why Trump should be convicted of inciting the siege.The House is continuing its case Thursday, with Trump’s lawyers to launch their defense by week’s end. Democrats plan to use their remaining hours of arguments to lay out the physical and mental harm caused by the attack, discuss Trump’s lack of action as it unfolded and do a final presentation on the legal issues involved, according to aides working on the impeachment team. The aides were granted anonymity to preview the arguments.The footage shown at trial, much of it never before seen, has included video of the mob smashing into the building, distraught members of Congress receiving comfort, rioters engaging in hand-to-hand combat with police and audio of Capitol police officers pleading for back-up. It underscored how dangerously close the rioters came to the nation’s leaders, shifting the focus of the trial from an academic debate about the Constitution to a raw retelling of the Jan. 6 assault.ADVERTISEMENT.Videos of the siege have been circulating since the day of the riot, but the graphic compilation shown to senators Wednesday amounted to a more complete narrative, a moment-by-moment retelling of one of the nation’s most alarming days. It offered fresh details into the attackers, scenes of police heroism and staff whispers of despair.The footage included rioters roaming the halls chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” some equipped with combat gear. Outside, the mob had set up a makeshift gallows. And in one wrenching moment, police were shown shooting and killing a San Diego woman, Ashli Babbitt, as the mob tried to break through doors near the House Chamber.MORE ON THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL.Pence, who had been presiding over a session to certify Joe Biden’s election victory over Trump — thus earning Trump’s censure — was shown being rushed to safety, where he sheltered in an office with his family just 100 feet from the rioters. Pelosi was seen being evacuated from the complex as her staff hid behind doors in her suite of offices.Though most of the Senate jurors seem to have made up their minds, making Trump’s acquittal likely, they sat riveted as the jarring video played in the chamber. Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma bent his head at one point, another GOP colleague putting his hand on his arm in comfort.“They did it because Donald Trump sent them on this mission,” said House prosecutor Stacey Plaskett, the Democratic delegate representing the Virgin Islands, told them.“President Trump put a target on their backs and his mob broke into the Capitol to hunt them down.”.ADVERTISEMENT.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, saw himself in the footage, dashing down a hallway to avoid the mob. Romney said he hadn’t realized that officer Eugene Goodman, who has been praised as a hero for luring rioters away from the Senate doors, had been the one to direct him to safety.“That was overwhelmingly distressing and emotional,” he said.Earlier in the day, prosecutors laid out their case by methodically linking Trump’s verbal attacks on the election to the violence that resulted when hundreds of loyalists stormed the building. Trump did nothing to stem the violence and watched with “glee,” the Democrats said, as the mob ransacked the building. Five people died.The goal of the presentation was to cast Trump not as an innocent bystander but rather as the “inciter in chief” who spent months spreading falsehoods about the election. Using evocative language meant to match the horror of the day, they compared Trump to a fire chief who delights in seeing fires spread, not extinguished, and they compared his supporters to a cavalry in war.“This attack never would have happened, but for Donald Trump,” Rep. Madeleine Dean, one of the impeachment managers, said as she choked back emotion. “And so they came, draped in Trump’s flag, and used our flag, the American flag, to batter and to bludgeon.”.Thursday brings the second and final full day of House arguments, with the Trump legal team taking the lectern Friday and Saturday for up to 16 hours to lay out their defense. The difficulty facing Trump’s defense team became apparent at the start as they leaned on the process of the trial, unlike any other, rather than the substance of the case against the former president.The prosecutors on Wednesday aimed to preemptively rebut arguments that Trump’s lawyers have indicated are central to their defense, arguing for instance that there was no First Amendment protection for the president’s encouragement of the rioters. His lawyers are likely to blame the rioters themselves for the violence, but the Democrats’ presentation made clear that they view Trump as ultimately responsible.Trump is the first president to face an impeachment trial after leaving office and the first to be twice impeached. He is charged with “incitement of insurrection,” though his lawyers say his words were protected by the Constitution’s First Amendment and just a figure of speech. The prosecutors are arguing that Trump’s words weren’t just free speech but part of “the big lie” — his relentless efforts to sow doubts about the election results. Those began long before the votes were tabulated, revving up his followers to “stop the steal” though there was no evidence of substantial fraud.As the House impeachment managers make the case for holding Trump to account, the defense has countered that the Constitution doesn’t allow impeachment of a president who is out of office. Even though the Senate rejected that argument in Tuesday’s vote to proceed to the trial, the legal issue could resonate with Senate Republicans eager to acquit Trump without being seen as condoning his behavior.While six Republicans joined with Democrats to vote to proceed with the trial on Tuesday, the 56-44 vote was far from the two-thirds threshold of 67 votes needed for conviction.Minds did not seem to be changing Wednesday, even after senators watched the graphic video.“I’ve said many times that the president’s rhetoric is at time overheated, but this is not a referendum on whether you agree with everything the president says or tweets,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was among those leading the effort to challenge the Electoral College tally certifying the election. “This is instead a legal proceeding.”.It appears unlikely that the House prosecutors will call witnesses, and Trump has declined a request to testify. The trial is expected to continue into the weekend.Trump’s second impeachment trial is expected to diverge from the lengthy, complicated affair of a year ago. In that case, Trump was charged with having privately pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, then a Democratic rival for the presidency. It could be over in half the time.The Democratic-led House impeached the president swiftly, one week after the attack.Connect with the definitive source for global and local news.More from AP.',

    title: `'Overwhelm the problem': Inside Biden’s war on COVID-19`,
    publisher: 'Associated Press',
    text:
      'By ZEKE MILLERFebruary 11, 2021 GMT.WASHINGTON (AP) — The meetings begin each day not long after dawn. Dozens of aides report in, coffee in hand, joining by Zoom from agency headquarters, their homes or even adjacent offices.The sessions start with the latest sobering statistics meant to focus the work and offer a reminder of what’s at stake: new coronavirus cases, people in hospitals, deaths. But they also include the latest signs of progress: COVID-19 tests administered, vaccine doses shipped , shots injected.Where the last administration addressed the pandemic with the vernacular of a natural disaster — using the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s mantra of a “federally supported, state managed and locally executed” response — President Joe Biden’s team is borrowing from the Pentagon and the doctrine of overwhelming force.“We’re at war with this virus,” COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said in an interview with The Associated Press between Sunday morning meetings on the response. “We’re taking every resource and tool the federal government has to battle on every front.”.It’s a strategy facing urgent tests after Biden inherited an inconsistent vaccine distribution plan and with the emerging threats from new virus variants.The goal, Biden aides say, is as simple as it is ambitious: After a year of being on defense they want to take the fight to the virus — to “overwhelm the problem,” a kind of mantra for the team.The campaign is being waged in schools and sterile pharmaceutical plants, on the vast blacktop of stadium parking lots and along the sidewalks outside Americans’ homes. To defeat the virus, Biden’s team must oversee a herculean logistical effort to put shots into hundreds of millions of arms, but also overcome vaccine hesitance, politically charged science skepticism and fatigue across all corners of society after nearly a year of hardship.For Biden, beating back the pandemic is a defining challenge of his presidency, testing his central promise to the American people that he can better manage the outbreak than his predecessor. His team seemingly day by day rolls out an almost dizzying array of new efforts and appeals large and small — everything from building a surgical glove factory in the U.S. by year’s end to asking Americans to wear masks while walking their dogs.More COVID-19 News:.“They’re taking exactly the right approach,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. “The federal government is taking responsibility, instead of leaving everything to state and local governments and blaming others when things go wrong.”.ADVERTISEMENT.For all of the activity, though, Biden knows that there are more grim statistics to come before Americans can return to any semblance of the “before days.”.More Americans have died from COVID-19 in the last year than died during combat in World War II, and some projections show the death toll could top that of the Civil War by the beginning of summer.New virus cases, which had been at historic highs following the holiday season, have steadily declined over Biden’s early weeks in office, but still remain worrisomely elevated, and lives are still being lost at a rate of about 21,000 per week.Since he took office three weeks ago, Biden’s team has attacked the problem on multiple fronts. They have unleashed billions of federal dollars to boost vaccinations and testing and developed a model to deploy more than 10,000 active-duty troops to join even more members of the National Guard to put shots into arms. Mass vaccination sites, supported by federal troops, are set to open in California, Texas and New York in coming weeks.As concerns grow about potentially dangerous mutations in the virus, Biden aides view the vaccines less as a silver bullet and more as part of a complementary series of moves that taken together offer the prospect of real progress.And for the U.S. to fully contain the problem, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has warned that the pace of vaccinations must increase globally to curtail the mutants.“We’re not going to sugarcoat in any way how hard this is, but we’re going to demonstrate clear evidence of progress and action,” Zients said.Biden is already well on pace to exceed his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office. It’s an assuredly achievable goal that some consider inadequate but also a break from the off-base predictions of the Trump administration that undercut public confidence. According to the Centers from Disease Control and Prevention, at least 26 million doses have been administered in Biden’s first three weeks in office.Much of the improvement in vaccination deliveries so far has been due to long-planned manufacturing ramp-ups, not the actions of the Biden team, aides acknowledge. But with the prospect of a third vaccine receiving approval in coming weeks, they are trying to anticipate and eliminate the next set of bottlenecks, when capacity to deliver injections and demand for vaccines become limiting factors.Wen urged the Biden administration to set more aggressive targets — a moon shot — to increase the pace of vaccinations to 3 million per day. “I think they just need to be a lot more ambitious when they talk to the public,” she said.Beyond the focus on sheer numbers of shots delivered, there is question of whose arms.Biden’s team has taken an increased role in determining where each vial of vaccine goes, with an eye on ensuring that lower-income, rural and minority communities are covered, an implicit criticism of how some states have handled their rollouts.New distributions to community health centers, announced Tuesday, and a 1 million weekly dose pharmacy program being rolled out this week will allow the White House to directly steer vaccines to underserved communities.The ideas are not without their critics. On a call with the White House on Tuesday, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson appealed to the administration to work through states rather than alternative distribution avenues, arguing they have excess demand they already can’t meet. Other governors expressed concern that the federal program would upend their own plans to use those health centers to distribute vaccines.“While governors appreciate the federal partnership, it is important that any increase in manufacturing capacity for vaccines should go to the states for distribution and not duplicated through separate federal programs,” Hutchinson told the AP.The White House has defended them as pilot programs that can be scaled up to more sites with more doses if they prove to be effective.In one key instance, the more hands-on federal response has meant the Biden White House has taken a step back.Where the Trump White House got involved in editing CDC guidance for businesses, travel and schools — prompting complaints about meddling with science and leading some states to adopt their own more stringent protocols — the Biden administration is leaving it to career scientists to craft policies.New, more prescriptive federal guidance on schools is expected as soon as Friday. While Biden in December promised that “the majority of our schools can be open by the end of my first 100 days,” his administration has since narrowed that goal to cover just K-8 schools, and even then, plans to count success as being open just a single day per week.That’s drawing criticism from some Republicans who say Biden is setting the bar too low and for ignoring the lessons of schools that have remained open for most of the pandemic.One early success of the Biden plan was born out of conversations with governors frustrated about constantly fluctuating vaccine supplies. The lack of certainty led some states to slow the administration of first doses to ensure enough second shots would be available if deliveries dropped. Biden’s team pledged to give states three weeks notice on what’s coming their way.“We now see more vaccine on the horizon than we did a few weeks ago,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, told the AP. “The more we learn about more vaccine the happier I am.”.Early reviews from the public of Biden’s response have been largely positive.Two weeks into Biden’s administration, a Quinnipiac poll showed 61% of Americans approving of the way the president is handling the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly all Democrats and 33% of Republicans said they approve. In a December Quinnipiac poll, 39% of Americans approved of the way President Donald Trump was handling the coronavirus pandemic. Seventy-eight percent of Republicans, but just 3% of Democrats, approved.Biden’s national strategy for the pandemic, released on his second day in office, provides the roadmap for the months ahead: more testing, clear guidance, and more and equitable vaccinations.But the path to a “new normal” is still unclear. The science on what will be necessary to achieve “herd immunity,” particularly with the rise of new mutations, remains unresolved.The Biden team is already actively working with pharmaceutical companies to prepare “booster” shots for the variants, potentially annually, like flu vaccines. And they’re building the infrastructure to ramp up testing for the virus, given that testing could be part of life for years to come.Biden’s call for Americans to wear a mask for his first 100 days will undoubtedly be extended, aides said. And his other goals are likely to be adjusted upward in coming months.___.Associated Press writers Hannah Fingerhut and Jonathan Lemire in Washington and Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas, contributed to this report.Connect with the definitive source for global and local news.More from AP.',

    title: `COVID-defying nun toasts 117th birthday with wine and prayer`,
    publisher: 'Associated Press',

      'PARIS (AP) — Question: How does one cram enough candles onto a birthday cake for one of the world’s oldest survivors of COVID-19? Answer: With 117 candles, you can’t.A French nun who is believed to be the world’s second-oldest person celebrated her 117th birthday in style on Thursday, with multiple treats and well-wishes, cards and flowers to fete her exceptional longevity through two world wars and a recent coronavirus infection.Sister André also got a Mass in her honor and a feast with Champagne, red wine and port. Then came a nap followed by more festivities, including an afternoon snack of baked Alaska, her favorite dessert.ADVERTISEMENT.“It made me very, very, very, very happy,” the birthday girl said. “Because I met all those I love and I thank the heavens for giving them to me. I thank God for the trouble they went to.”.Sister André’s big day got rolling with a morning video call with her great-nephews and great-great nephews, followed by a Mass in her honor led by the local Catholic bishop, said David Tavella, the communications manager for the care home in the southern French city of Toulon where the nun lives.Her birthday feast included a starter of foie gras, followed by capon with fragrant mushrooms. “All of it washed down with red wine, because she drinks red wine. It’s one of her secrets of longevity,” Tavella told The Associated Press. There was also port and Champagne “because 117 years have to be toasted,” he said.She skipped dessert because she was tired, but got it served to her later after a nap — with three candles and the numerals 117 on top.Packing on 117 candles would have been impossible.“We stopped trying a long time ago,” Tavella said. “Even if we made big cakes, I’m not sure that she would have enough breath to blow them all out. You would need a fire extinguisher.”.Sister André’s birth name is Lucile Randon. The Gerontology Research Group , which validates details of people thought to be 110 or older, lists her as the second-oldest known living person in the world, behind only an 118-year-old woman in Japan, Kane Tanaka .Tavella told French media earlier this week that Sister André tested positive for the coronavirus in mid-January but she had so few symptoms that she didn’t even realize she was infected. Her survival made headlines both in France and beyond.ADVERTISEMENT.“When the whole world suddenly started talking about this story, I understood that Sister André was a bit like an Olympic flame on a ’round the world tour that people want to grab hold of, because we all need a bit of hope at the moment,” Tavella said.When Tavella talked to her Thursday about celebrating her next birthday in 2022, she replied: “I won’t be here next year,” he quoted her as saying, adding: “But she has been saying that for 10 years.”.By strange coincidence, Tavella celebrated his 43rd birthday on Thursday.___.Connect with the definitive source for global and local news.More from AP.',

    title: `Senate acquits Trump as Republicans save him in impeachment again`,
    publisher: 'Reuters',
    text: `WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate acquitted Donald Trump on Saturday in his second impeachment trial in a year, with fellow Republicans blocking conviction over the former president’s role in the deadly assault by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol.

    The Senate vote of 57-43 fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection after a five-day trial in the same building ransacked by his followers on Jan. 6 shortly after they heard him deliver an incendiary speech.

    In the vote, seven of the 50 Senate Republicans joined the chamber’s unified Democrats in favoring conviction.

    Trump left office on Jan. 20, so impeachment could not be used to remove him from power. But Democrats had hoped to secure a conviction to hold him responsible for a siege that left five people including a police officer dead and to set the stage for a vote to bar him from ever serving in public office again. Given the chance to hold office in the future, they argued, Trump would not hesitate to encourage political violence again.

    Trump’s attorneys argued that his words at the rally were protected by his constitutional right to free speech and said he was not given due process in the proceedings.

    Republicans saved Trump in the Feb. 5, 2020, vote in his first impeachment trial, when only one senator from their ranks - Mitt Romney - voted to convict and remove him from office.

    Romney voted for impeachment on Saturday along with fellow Republicans Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Ben Sasse, Pat Toomey, and Lisa Murkowski.

    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who voted “not guilty,” offered scathing remarks about the former president after the verdict.

    “There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,” he said. “The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.”

    The drama on the Senate floor unfolded against a backdrop of gaping divisions in a pandemic-weary United States along political, racial, socioeconomic and regional lines. The trial provided more partisan warfare even as Democratic President Joe Biden, who took office on Jan. 20 after defeating Trump in the November election, called for healing and unity after his predecessor’s four turbulent years in power and a caustic election campaign.

    Seventy-one percent of American adults, including nearly half of all Republicans, believe Trump was at least partially responsible for starting the Capitol assault, but only about half of the country thought Trump should be convicted of inciting insurrection, according to an Ipsos poll conducted for Reuters.

    Trump, 74, continues to hold a grip on his party with a right-wing populist appeal and “America First” message. The wealthy businessman-turned-politician has considered running for president again in 2024.

    Trump is only the third president ever to be impeached by the House of Representatives - a step akin to a criminal indictment - as well as the first to be impeached twice and the first to face an impeachment trial after leaving office. But the Senate still has never convicted an impeached president.

    Democrats forged ahead with impeachment despite knowing it could overshadow critical early weeks of Biden’s presidency.

    The House approved the single article of impeachment against Trump on Jan. 13, with 10 Republicans joining the chamber’s Democratic majority. That vote came a week after the pro-Trump mob stormed the neoclassical domed Capitol, interrupted the formal congressional certification of Biden’s victory, clashed with an overwhelmed police force, invaded the hallowed House and Senate chambers, and sent lawmakers into hiding for their own safety.

    Shortly before the rampage, Trump urged his followers to march on the Capitol, repeated his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud, and told them that “if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”

    During the trial, nine House lawmakers serving as trial managers, or prosecutors, urged senators to convict Trump to hold him accountable for a crime against American democracy and to prevent a repeat in the future. They played searing video of rioters swarming inside the Capitol and making violent threats toward politicians including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence. The House managers said Trump summoned the mob to Washington, gave the crowd its marching orders and then did nothing to stop the ensuing violence.

    The defense lawyers accused Democrats not only of trying to silence Trump as a political opponent they feared facing in the future but of attempting to criminalize political speech with which they disagreed and aiming to cancel the voices of the tens of millions of voters who backed him.

    Trump’s lawyers argued the trial was unconstitutional because he had already left office. The words Trump used, they argued, were no different than those regularly employed by Democrats.

    In his previous impeachment trial, the Senate voted to acquit Trump on two charges - abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. That impeachment arose from Trump’s 2019 pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden as he sought foreign aid to sully a domestic political rival.

    A common theme in the charges at the heart of the two impeachments was Trump’s abandonment of accepted democratic norms to advance his own political interests.

    The U.S. Constitution sets out impeachment as the instrument with which the Congress can remove and bar from future office presidents who commit “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”

    Impeachment, once a rare occurrence, has become more commonplace during America’s era of poisonous political polarization in recent decades. In the 209 years after the first U.S. president, George Washington, took office in 1789, there was only one impeachment.

    Since 1998, there have been three, including Trump’s two. Andrew Johnson was impeached and acquitted in 1868 in the aftermath of the American Civil War and Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 and acquitted in 1999 of charges stemming from a sex scandal.

    Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 rather than face impeachment over the Watergate scandal.

    Trump’s acquittal does not end the possibility of other congressional action against him such as a censure motion. Republicans seemed dead set against an idea floated by Democrats of invoking the Constitution’s 14th Amendment provision barring from public office anyone who has “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the government.

    The impeachment proceedings also can be viewed in the context of a battle for the future of the Republican Party. Some Republicans - mostly moderates and establishment figures - have voiced alarm at the direction Trump has taken their party. Detractors have accused Trump - who had never before held public office - of undermining the institutions of democracy, encouraging a cult of personality and pursuing policies built around “white grievance” in a nation with a growing non-white population.`,

Photo illustration: George Downs/WSJ.By Dave Michaels.Updated Feb. 11, 2021 1:47 pm ET.WASHINGTON—Federal prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether market manipulation or other types of misconduct fueled the rapid rise last month in prices of stocks such as GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.The Justice Department’s fraud section and the San Francisco U.S. attorney’s office have sought information about the activity from brokers and social-media companies that were hubs for the trading frenzy, the people said. Prosecutors have subpoenaed information from brokers such as Robinhood Markets Inc., the popular online brokerage that many individual investors used to trade GameStop and other shares, the people said.GameStop shares surged from about $20 to $483 over a period of two weeks in January. The stock has since fallen to around $50. It was fueled by an army of bullish individual traders exhorting one another on Reddit to buy the shares and squeeze hedge funds that bet the price would fall. Traders who bet stock prices will decline are known as short sellers.In addition to the probe by the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is examining similar trading, the people said. The CFTC has opened a preliminary investigation into whether misconduct occurred as some Reddit traders targeted silver futures and the largest exchange-traded fund tied to silver, the iShares Silver Trust , one of the people said.The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the trading frenzy as well.

    title: `The fake fight over your Social Security benefits`,
    publisher: `Before It's News | People Powered News`,
    text: `% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. Kiplinger’s is supposed to know what they are writing about. Hah! Here is an article that appeared in today’s Chicago Tribune. You decide whether Kiplinger’s Managing Editor knows what she is writing about. Biden’s plan to strengthen Social Security By Catherine Siskos, managing editor at Kiplinger’s Retirement Report In 2021, Social Security is expected to begin drawing down its trust fund to cover benefits inste of tapping only the interest. Right away, we are greeted with the Big Lie that federal taxes fund federal spending. While, state and local government taxes fund state and local government spending, federal taxes do not fund federal spending. That is a major difference most people  not understand. Because the U.S. federal government uniquely is Monetarily Sovereign , it has the unlimited ability to create its own sovereign currency. The U.S. government never c run short of U.S. dollars. Even if payroll tax collections fell to $0, the federal government could continue to fund Social Security, forever. An example of instructions: “Pay to the order of . . . “ Why can the U.S. government never run short of dollars? Because it pays creditors with instructions, not with dollars. It never can run short of instructions, which  creates from thin air, simply by voting. To pay for its spending, the federal government creates new dollars, ad hoc, by creating and sending instructions to each creditor’s bank, instructing the bank  increase the balance in the creditor’s checking account. The instructions are in the form of a paper check or more commonly a wire, both of which begin with the instructions, “Pay to the order of __________.” When the creditor’s bank does as instructed (by pressing a computer key), new dollars instantly are created and are added to the M1 money supply. It is the bank th does the actual money creation. The creditor’s bank then balances its books by getting approval from (i.e. “clearing” the government’s instructions through) the Federal Reserve Bank, and t money-creation cycle is complete. What then becomes of the tax dollars sent to the U.S. Treasury? They are destroyed . They cease to exist in any money supply measure. That is why no one on earth can answer the question, “How much money does the U.S. federal government have?” Depending on your perspective, the answer either is “$0” or “infinite.” Personally, I prefer “infinite,” because the Treasury does carry a comparatively small account with the Federal Reserve Bank. And by the way, remember that bolded phrase above, “instead of tapping only the interest?” Guess where the interest comes from. It comes from the fake “trust fund’s” investment in Treasury Securities. The U.S. Treasury creates dollars from thin air to pay interest to a non-existent U.S. federal “trust fund. ” The U.S. Treasury instead simply could create dollars  fund Social Security, and do away with the bookkeeping mumbo-jumbo. Unless Congress acts, benefits will be cut at least 20% when the trust fund runs out of money in 2033 — two years sooner than previously projected, according to t Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. At that point, the program will rely entirely on payroll taxes, which currently aren’t enough to fully fund Soci Security. Unless Congress acts, your benefits will be cut, but not because the fake “trust fund” runs out of money. Benefits will be cut because Congress created the fake “tru fund” as a device to limit your benefits. Medicare Part A has a similar fake “trust fund,” which also is running short of money, while Medicare Part B has no trust fund, so it cannot run short of money. Hmmm . . . Does that give you any ideas? How about using the Medicare Part B system for Medicare Part A and for Social Security? That way, we never would have to hear false warnings about running short of money, and we could dispense with deceptive articles like this one from Kiplingers. President Joe Biden wants to expand Social Security in two ways. He would raise benefits for the people most in need: low-wage workers, surviving spouses of dual-earn couples, caregivers, government workers and those who have been collecting Social Security the longest. (The rationale for that last group? Seniors have higher medic and long-term care expenses later in life.) Everyone else’s benefits would remain the same, but their Social Security cost-of-living adjustments would increase becau Biden supports switching to the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly. The CPI-E is considered a better measure of inflation for older adults because it weights seni citizens’ biggest expenses, such as health care and housing, more heavily. The Social Security Administration estimates that switching to the CPI-E from the current wa earners index will raise annual COLAs 0.2 percentage points, on average. To pay for these changes, Biden wants to increase Social Security payroll taxes on people earning more than $400,000 a year, a short-term fix that would also shore  the program for only another five years, Melissa M. Favreault predicts in an analysis for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. She is a senior fellow in the Income a Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Does the “senior fellow in the Tax Policy Center at the Urban-Brookings Institute really believe that Social Security taxes fund Social Security benefits? Or is s merely parroting the Big Lie for political reasons? Proposed legislation from Rep. John Larson, a Democrat, would secure the program’s funding for 75 years. Along with the increase on those earning more than $400,000 th Biden has proposed, the bill calls for raising the payroll tax for everyone, with employees and employers each contributing an additional 1.2%, or roughly 50 cents mo per week, estimates Social Security in an independent analysis of the bill. The increase would be phased in between now and 2043. In a divided Congress, Democrats a Republicans could find common ground with smaller bills, such as one to reinflate Social Security benefits for people born in 1960 or 1961, says Max Richtman, preside and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Their benefits will be cut`,

    title: `Trump Assassination Foiled, Deep State in Panic Mode!`,
    publisher: `Before It's News | People Powered News`,
    text: ` On Tuesday morning at approximately 3:00 am, a sniper’s bullet struck a panoramic casement window on the east wall of Trump’s bedroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The rou might have slain Trump had he not recently replaced tempered glass with Blast Structures International’s bullet resistant glass, which, according to the company website, can stop anything less powerful than a .50 round. A confidential source within Trump’s inner circle told Real Raw News that Trump was asleep in bed, and, a light sleeper, was awakened by the “sharp crack” of the bull striking glass. The round did not penetrate the glass, but caused a material-science dissipation fracture, or spiderweb pattern. The strike, our source said, triggered a silent alarm that instantly notified the Palm Beach Police Dept. and Trump’s Secret Service Detail, which sleeps in a gue house ten yards from the main building. Agents whisked Trump to safety, escorting him to a fortified saferoom, and said they’d coordinate with local authorities. But Trump demanded they call the Palm Beach Police Dept. and say it was a false alarm. “Trump was adamant no police get involved,” our source said. “He told his guys he wants to keep it in the family. No law enforcement. No media. He was very stern abo keeping the media blind to the event. Trump made a phone call, and inside of thirty minutes, some heavy-hitting dudes who were definitely not Secret Service arrived  the estate,” our source said. With Trump safe, his private security fanned across the 20-acre estate searching for signs of intrusion, while the Secret Service detail began its own investigation  to how a would-be assassin got within shooting distance of one of the most secure residences in the world. At 7:00am a forensic ballistic expert from Quantico arrived at Mar-a-Lago and determined the bullet fragments were from a 7mm Remington Magnum round. He found himse amid an intractable dilemma, our source said. The round had been fired at a downward angle and, had it pierced glass, would have sizzled through Trump’s skull, but  attack on the east window meant one of two things. The sniper had taken the shot from either estate grounds, which lacks elevated terrain, or from somewhere above t Atlantic swell, a seemingly impossible feat. “Trump’s bedroom is 23 feet above ground level. Besides the main building, no structure on the property is higher. The ballistics guy figured the shot could only ha been made by someone in a hovering helicopter two hundred yards or more off the coast. If true, that guy must have been the best marksman in the world. From a helicopt and at night. Crazy,” our source said. The concept of sniping from a helicopter seemed so unrealistic that RRL reached out to Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Hunter Bernius, a scout-sniper and instructor at t Marine Corps. School of Infantry in Geiger, North Carolina. Without mentioning the nature of our inquiry, we asked Staff Sgt. Bernius about the odds of successful pulling off a 200-400 yard shot from a hovering chopper with little or no natural light. “Only with proper training specifically for that type of mission. To shoot precisely, the shooter has to account for aircraft vibration and wind speed and direction, a wind whipping up around him from blades spinning at 400rpm. Then there’s a dozen other variables. Takes months and months of training from a qualified instructor, a there’s still no guarantee. Aerial sniping is a skill all its own,” Staff Sgt. Bernius said. By noon, the Secret Service had discretely interviewed all persons on estate property, but no one reported seeing or hearing a helicopter, or hearing gunfire. According to our source, Trump’s people suspected the attack was carried out by the Deep State, to stop Trump from amassing incriminating evidence that, if release could sink every Democrat from Joe Biden to the most junior member of the Democratic caucus.

    title: `POTUS Authorizes Firing Squad Executions While Kamala Harris Remains In Hiding`,
    publisher: `Your News Wire`,
    text: `President Trump has amended federal execution rules to allow death by firing squad, sparking rumors that this may be the reason why Kamala Harris has gone into hiding since election day. Harris’ disappearance is noteworthy – with her being the former top prosecutor in California, she knows America’s federal laws about fraudulent elections and treason, and also knows the grave significance of Attorney Sidney Powell having just revealed her evidence proving 10-million votes were stolen for Biden. The claim that President Trump is going after traitors were also confirmed this week by retired US Army Major Jeffrey Prather, founder of the Warriorschool, that since 1995, has trained the US Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard special forces, as well as most US federal law enforcement agencies such the FBI, DHS, US Marshals and Border Patrol. In an interview with Natural News, Prather laid out how President Trump, the Department of Defense and acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller were going to defeat Deep State traitors and save America from the attempted coup.
    Partial summary as follows: “Confirms that multiple raids on the servers of vote rigging systems were conducted, in three countries…Confirms that the NSA has hard evidence on treasonous actors, and that this evidence is likely being leveraged by Trump’s people…Confirms that Trump can use the NDAA, combined with the Sep. 12, 2018 Executive Order, to declare domestic treasonous actors as “enemy combatants”…Says that the DoD and patriots inside the DIA have everything they need to defeat the deep state…Says Trump will be President on January 21st…Warns that the transition from information warfare to conventional (kinetic) warfare may happen very soon…Warns that the left-wing backlash against Trump’s victory will result in bloodshed that cannot be avoided”.`,

    title: `WikiLeaks BOMBSHELL: Dominion Exec Told Podesta “I’ll Do Anything To Defeat Trump”`,
    publisher: `Your News Wire`,
    text: `An email previously released by WikiLeaks reveals that a Dominion executive met with John Podesta to plot ways to help defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election. In 2018, Dominion Voting announced that it had been acquired by its management team and Staple Street Capital, a New York-based private equity firm, who was being advised by Kirkland & Ellis LLP. According to 2015 email chain released by WikiLeaks, Kirkland & Ellis LLP partner Kamran S. Bajwa met with John Podesta to offer “anything” to help defeat Trump. At that time, Podesta was chair of Hillary Clinton’s U.S. presidential campaign. On Saturday, December 19, 2015, Bajwa wrote the following to John Podesta: “it was a pleasure to meet this past Th in NY. As discussed, I want to do whatever I can by way of sharing ideas, raising funds, recruiting campaign volunteers, and anything else that can help with your campaign. I hope my small efforts to introduce you to a growing group of professionals like myself will be able to boost your important work for Secretary Clinton’s campaign.” “I come to NY frequently and would welcome the opportunity to sit with you and discuss the best way to coordinate our efforts. If you will be in NY Jan 5, I will be free that day to meet you at any time and place convenient for you.” Podesta followed up by emailing: “can’t remember whether we discussed Trump’s effect on ISIS/radical recruitment. You following that?” “John, just a quick note to say I was catching up with my senior partner Bill Singer back in the office and letting him know of my intentions to help your campaign as much as I can. He was very effusive in his praise of you and asked me to send along his regards. I will look forward to being touch after the break,” Bajwa wrote back on December 21. On January 2, 2016, Bajwa eagerly followed up again, asking to meet with Podesta. He said: “I wanted to follow up on our brief conversation a few weeks back and see if you would be available to meet this coming Tuesday in NY? I will be in town for work and my schedule is flexible on Tuesday so if you can meet, I can come to you at a convenient time and place anytime prior to 5pm.” Podesta then forwarded the email chain to Clinton campaign staffer Milia Fisher and asked her to schedule the meeting for him.`,

    title: `Parler Is A Great Place For People Who Are Into ‘Crazy Stuff’ Says Bill Gates`,
    publisher: `Your News Wire`,
    text: `Bill Gates is not a fan of the social media platform Parler and has mocked its users by saying it is a safe space for people who are into “crazy stuff”. According to Gates “If you want Holocaust denial, hey, Parler is going to be great for you.” Gates said he believed that social media platforms need to face stronger regulation in the U.S. to help manage the spread of fake news and says Facebook and Twitter are doing a far better job in monitoring misinformation than Parler. Truth is Mr Gates just does not like the idea of ‘free speech’ and is against a platform that does not censor anything that might go against the offiicial narrative. Parler has promoted itself as a proponent of “free expression without violence and censorship” It describes itself as “unbiased social media focused on real user experience and engagement.” It’s promise of less censorship has attracted users who have been censored or banned on mainstream social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Numerous Conservative journalists, media personalities and politicians have joined Parler over the past few months. Following election day, the platform has seen a huge increase in new users and it will continue to grow if Facebook and Twitter continue their censorship of conservative opinions.`,
